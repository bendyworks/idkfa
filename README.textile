h1. idkfa

Storing keys in your repository is A Bad Idea&trade;. With @idkfa@, you can store them in a YAML file outside your repository yet include them easily.

Once installed and setup with @Idkfa.load_keys@, your sensitive information will be stored in upper-cased keys inside @ENV@.

Why "idkfa?" Haven't you played Doom?

h2. Usage with Rails

* Add @gem 'idkfa'@ to your @Gemfile@

  ...
end
